One of the very first questions you’ll have to answer when you start your car hunt is “new or used?” To help you make up your mind, we’ve outlined a few of the key points for and against both options.  It is no secret that we live in one of the most “marketed-to” cultures in the world, and with this in mind, we need to make sure we keep a cool head and cultivate the discipline to resist overspending, or else we will find ourselves with an empty bank account. </div>
